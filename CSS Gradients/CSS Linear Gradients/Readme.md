To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops.
Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among.
You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
Direction - Top to Bottom (this is default)
