              A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, (born Oct. 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died
              July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian president (2002–07). After
              graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam played a
              leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
              weapons programs. He planned a program that produced a number of
              successful missiles, helping earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”
              Beginning in the early 1990s, he also served as scientific adviser
              to the government, and his prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear
              weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero. In 2002 the
              Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic Alliance
              nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing President K.R.
              Narayanan. Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the
              largely ceremonial post he sought to use science and technology to
              transform India into a developed country. In 2007 he was succeeded
              by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.
